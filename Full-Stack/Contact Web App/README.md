# Contact Management Web Application

## Project Description
The Contact Management Web Application is a web-based system that allows users to store and manage contact details. It provides features for adding new contacts, updating existing contacts, deleting contacts, and uploading profile photos. The frontend of the application is built using React.js, while the backend is implemented with Spring Boot.

### Tech Stack
Frontend:
- React.js
- React Router
- React Toastify
- Axios (for API requests)
- Bootstrap (for styling)
Backend:
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA
- Spring Web
- Spring Boot DevTools
Database:
- PostgreSQL
Other:
- Lombok (for reducing boilerplate code)
- Java 22

### Why This Tech Stack?
- **React.js:** Provides a modern and efficient frontend framework for building user interfaces.
- **Spring Boot:** Offers a powerful and easy-to-configure backend framework for developing RESTful APIs.
- **Bootstrap:** Helps in quickly styling the frontend components and making the UI responsive.
- **Lombok:** Reduces boilerplate code in Java classes, improving code readability and maintainability.

### Challenges Faced
During the development of this project, some challenges were encountered:
- Integrating React.js with Spring Boot to create a full-stack application.
- Handling file uploads for profile photos and managing images on the server.
- Implementing CRUD operations for managing contact details efficiently.

### Future Scope
- Implementing user authentication and authorization for secure access to the application.
- Adding search and filtering functionalities to easily find and manage contacts.
- Enhancing the UI/UX with more interactive features and animations.
